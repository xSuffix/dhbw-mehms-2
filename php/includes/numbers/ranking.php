      <h3>Introductory Words - Our Efforts</h3>
      <hr>
      <p>
        There are almost infinite different numbers and we don't even use the majority of these in our
        lifetimes. However, we still did the effort
        and went through their known entirety. We finally managed to gather a list containing the Top 10
        discovered numbers using criteria like usability,
        usage but also rather neglected aspects with examples being aesthetics or the numbers' meanings. This
        list is not final by any means though,
        as there are still countless people counting days and nights to find new numbers unknown to mankind by
        now and maybe the one or another may surpass the currently chosen ones
        and receive its representation in an updated and corrected ranking.<br>
        You may be surprised to recognize or know only a few of the following numbers, some of these might be a
        recurring part of the
        average person's regular life while other numbers could be seen for the first time.<br>
        So get ready for an awesome experience and enjoy the read!

        <p>
          As a clear fan favorite, '420' has to be a part of this ranking, and its appearance is not even
          undeserved: the so-called "Weed Number" has also other interesting characteristics. It is divisible
          by its checksum and contains
          the three smallest positive even numbers...

          '3' is not just a number, in this case it rather stands for the concept of trinity that is used

          And yet another number connoted with mysticism and spirituality. It is almost a guaranteed member of
          a fairy-tale like the 7 dwarves
          in Snow White and has also other interesting appearances: in the genesis, the world was created in a
          week that consists of...

          The biggest number in this listing, however the most interesting fact about '2.147.483.648' is
          that this number does literally not exist in this shape. You can not count up to it, even thinking
          of this number is hard, as it...

          This number cannot miss the list, as it is not just the first number most people get to know, but
          also finding its place in most number
          systems, with its own being probably the weirdest one could imagine: the unary system. It is also a
          central part of sign-value-notation:

          Most likely, you have never heard about this number before. It is a worthy competitor though,
          especially
          due to its aesthetics as it is not just palindromic (something that is the same back- and forwards)
          but also contains the artistic complementary...

      <h3>Honorable mentions: those who did not make it</h3>
      <hr>
      <p>
        Before we will finish with our #1 pick, we want to present you a few honorable mentions that were quite
        close but in the end
        did not make it into the final list. We had the number <span class="blue">79997</span>, a palindromic
        prime number with a weird shape. However,
        the weirdness of its shape made us prefer '97379' over it. <br>
        The next is a tuple of two very interesting numbers: <span class="blue">12</span> and <span class="blue">13</span>, which are known for their biblical meaning like
        the product of the two important numbers 4 and 3 or the apostles' count and the '13' as the symbol of
        bad omens, mostly connoted with a friday.<br>
        The last number worth mentioning is the <span class="blue">2</span> as the only even prime number and
        the represantation of duality, as a concept. <br>
        But let's close this and continue the list with our final pick!
