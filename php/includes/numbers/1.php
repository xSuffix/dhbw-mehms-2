            <p>This number cannot miss the list, as it is not just the first number most people get to know, but also
                finding its place in most number
                systems, with its own being probably the weirdest one could imagine: the unary system. It is also a
                central part of sign-value-notation:
                as everyone who had counted at least a few numbers up could agree, the smallest step between two
                integers is always 1.<br>
                Everytime something is counted, 1 is part of it: the number deserves this spot due to its sheer
                importance, further advanced math is known
                for using it next to the number '0' as basically the only important integers.
