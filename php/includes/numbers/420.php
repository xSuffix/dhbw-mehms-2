        As a clear fan favorite, '420' has to be a part of this ranking, and its appearance is not even
        undeserved: the so-called "Weed Number" has also other interesting characteristics. It is divisible by
        its checksum and contains
        the three smallest positive even numbers in their respective order.<br>
        On top of that it is five times 84 and that number again is four times 21. If you add its checksum 3 to
        it, you end up at 24, which divided
        by its checksum 6 is 4. The number eventually is a bad sign in the Chinese culture, so I think it is
        clearly visible, why the number '420' is
        so special.
