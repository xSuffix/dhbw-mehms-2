                And yet another number connoted with mysticism and spirituality. It is almost a guaranteed member of a
                fairy-tale like the 7 dwarves
                in Snow White and has also other interesting appearances: in the genesis, the world was created in a
                week that consists of '7' days: the sum
                of the divine trinity (3) and the number of rationality (4). <br>
                But that is not everything: the number is liked a lot because of its mystical feeling and use, and we
                can see that it has been spread everywhere.
                We got 7 sins and 7 virtues, 7-league boots and the 7 horcruxes of the Harry Potter septology.
