        '3' is not just a number, in this case it rather stands for the concept of trinity that is used often in pop-cultural or
        esoteric means with the basic example being the church's 'Father, Son and Holy Spirit' or the general trinity of Abrahamic religions.
        Other uses are the application of splitting movie or book stories in trilogies to create a climactic structure chronologically (prequel, story, sequel), storyline-technical
        (beginning, climax, end) or financially (good original, cash, cash).<br>
        The usability of this method is incredibly high, because the number '3' is not just quite small but the structural seperation is very intuitive.
        That way there is a lot of trinity everywhere: three siblings, three hairs, three kings and so on.
